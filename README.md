# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a college student looking to refine my skills and enter the web development field. I primarily would want to work in front-end development, but I am open to work in the back-end of sides as well.
### My current skills are as follows:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- C#
- React.js

I am always looking to improve my skills and collaborate with others. Feel free to contact me through here or via Linkedin.
